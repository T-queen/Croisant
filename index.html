    <p>
      A croissant is a type of pastry that is shaped like a crescent moon. It is
      made with a dough that has many layers of butter, which makes it flaky and
      crispy. It is a traditional French pastry, but it was inspired by an
      Austrian pastry called kipferl12 Croissants can be eaten plain or with
      different fillings, such as chocolate, cheese, ham, or jam. They are
      usually eaten for breakfast, but they can also be served as dessert or
      snacks
